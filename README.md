# Job-Tracker
A repository for the creation of a job application tracker.
Hope is an cloud based tracking system for job applications,interviews and much more. The main aim is to help track what you've applied for, with the cv and motivation letter in order to look back and understand what went right and what went wrong. This app not only functions as an application tracker but also as your corporate journal where you can keep important memos, notes and your secure digital diary. It's a one stop shop for your corporate career.
